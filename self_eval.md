# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled most with determining what kind of brackets to enclose code in and making sure I was consistent and closing all brackets. There were also multiple times I forgot commas. I just need to slow down and make sure I type correctly. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I like to take notes when I am learning on my own and prefer to sit back and absorb during classtime learning. I take very brief notes. tonight I will be making a cheat sheet of all the terms and methods we have used and what kinds of brackets they use. 
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? If I have an idea that something could work, I will try to probelm solve in code. If I have no idea where to start, or I get stuck, that's when I turn to google.
